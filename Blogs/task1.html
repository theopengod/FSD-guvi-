<h2>What is HTTP</h2>
 <p>HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of the internet and the backbone of the World Wide Web. It's the protocol that enables web browsers and servers to communicate and exchange information. In recent years, there has been a significant shift in the way HTTP is used, with the introduction of a new version, HTTP/2. In this blog, we'll take a look at the critical differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, and explore the pros and cons of each.
   </p>
   <h2>HTTP 1.1</h2>
   <p>
    HTTP/1.1 is the most widely used version of the HTTP protocol. It was first defined in 1999 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and has been in use for over two decades. HTTP/1.1 is a simple, stateless protocol that allows clients (web browsers) to send requests to servers, and servers to send responses to clients. It's designed to work over various transport protocols, including TCP, and all modern web browsers support it.</p>
    <h2>HTTP 2</h2>
    <p>HTTP/2 is a replacement for how HTTP is expressed “on the wire.” It is not a ground-up rewrite of the protocol; HTTP methods, status codes and semantics are the same, and it should be possible to use the same APIs as HTTP/1.x (possibly with some small additions) to represent the protocol.

        The focus of the protocol is on performance; specifically, end-user perceived latency, network and server resource usage. One major goal is to allow the use of a single connection from browsers to a Web site.</p>
