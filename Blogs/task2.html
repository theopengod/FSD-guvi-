<h2>My Second Blog</h2>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>In simple terms. “A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method)”.

For example: Person, car, pen, bike, Personal Computer , Washing Machine etc.

Take the case of cars.

All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car. All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.</p>
<p>Let’s have an example of my favorite merc car and list out its properties(Features):
<ul>
    <li>Make: Tata </li>
    <li>Model: Harrier</li>
    <li>Color: White</li>
    <li>Fuel: Diesel</li>
    <li>Weight: 850kg</li>
    <li>Mileage: 18Kmpl</li>
    </p></body></ul>
    <p>
        Taking the above as reference, I'll break down on objects, Object properties and Methods.
    </p>
    <script>
        var car="Tata";
    </script>
    <p>The following code assigns a simple value (Mercedes) to a variable named car:</p>
    <h4>Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.</h4>
    <p>The following code assigns many values (Tata, Harrier, White and soo on) to a variable named Car:</p>
    <script>
        var car ={Make :"Tata",Model:"Harrier",Color:"White",Fuel:"Diesel",Weight:"850kg",Mileage:"18kmpl"};
    </script>
    <p>The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).</p>
    <h4>Syntax : var <object-name> = {key1: value1, key2: value2,... keyN: valueN};</h4>
        <p>So, conclusion and definition for JS objects is “JavaScript objects are containers for named values”.</p>
        <p>Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.</p>
        <p>The syntax for adding a property to an object is :
            ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;
        </p>
        <p>The syntax for deleting a property from an object is:delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;</p>
        <p>The syntax to access a property from an object is: objectName.property        // Car.Make

            //or
 
 objectName["property”]    // Car["Make"]</p>
 <p>So, Conclusion and simple definition for Java Script properties is “Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object”.</p>
